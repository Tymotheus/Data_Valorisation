# Introduction
This is the repo for 2023 Data Valorisation course at Polytech Nice.
As our project work we perform analysis of the Data Science and STEM Salaries dataset,
62,000+ STEM salaries scraped from levels.fyi.
The Kaggle dataset can be found here:

## First delivery
We took care of preprocessing and visualisation. We drew some first conclusions. The outcome was presented in a form of 10 minutes video which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIKk9Wc0Io8
## Notes for work:
0. The current working notebook is 2nd_delivery_notebook
1. Work only on the version from this repo. If you finish some feature, check that it is not causing errors, push it to this repo 
2. I cleaned the notebook a bit, I did some POC tree, don't know any theory behind it :)
3. Move plotting to some other place?
## Using our code
To use our code, get the data from the data folder and use one of the 2 R notebooks. Also make sure to mention us if you want to show your results to the world :)
## To do in the future:
- [ ] Tidy up all the files, move the .csv datasets to the separate folder
- [ ] Create the dockerfile for the project so you can run it out of the box
