# Notes for work:
0. The current working notebook is 2nd_delivery_notebook
1. Work only on the version from this repo. If you finish some feature, check that it is not causing errors, push it to this repo 
2. I cleaned the notebook a bit, I did some POC tree, don't know any theory behind it :)
3. Move plotting to some other place?
