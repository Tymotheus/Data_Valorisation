# Introduction
This is the repo for 2023 Data Valorisation course at Polytech Nice.
As our project work we perform analysis of the Data Science and STEM Salaries dataset,
62,000+ STEM salaries scraped from levels.fyi.
The Kaggle dataset can be found here:

## Authors
- **Marina Bueno García** (logistic regression + Support Vector Machine)
- **Tymoteusz Ciesielski** (regression decision trees + random forests)
- **Ewa Kupczyk** (regression decision trees + random forests)
- **Lucía Trillo Carreras** (logistic regression + Support Vector Machine)
## First delivery
We took care of preprocessing and visualisation. We drew some first conclusions. The outcome was presented in a form of 10 minutes video which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIKk9Wc0Io8
## Second delivery
We created the predictor models. We used linear regression, SVR, regression decision trees and random forests. The best result we obtained for the forest of 50 random trees - ~~**on average our model has an error in predcting the real salary by only 6%.**~~
## Using our code
To use our code, get the data from the data folder and use one of the 2 R notebooks. Also make sure to mention us if you want to show your results to the world :)
## To do in the future:
- [ ] Tidy up all the files, move the .csv datasets to the separate folder
- [ ] Create the dockerfile for the project so you can run it out of the box
